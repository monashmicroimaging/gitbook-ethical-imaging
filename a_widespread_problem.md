# A widespread problem {#widespread-problem}

In a 2012 survey\* \(Tavare “Scientific misconduct is worryingly prevalent in the UK, shows BMJ survey” _BMJ,_ 2012\) it was found that:

* 13% of respondents were aware of colleagues “inappropriately adjusting, excluding, altering, or fabricating data” for publication.

A separate review paper\* \(Fang, Steen, and Casadevall “Misconduct accounts for the majority of retracted scientific pubrlications” _PNAS,_ volume 109\(42\), 2012. DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1212247109\), looked at the reasons for retraction of over 2000 articles indexed by PubMed and found that:

* 67.4% of retractions were due to academic misconduct
* The percentage of scientific articles retracted because of fraud increased 10-fold between 1975 and 2012.

Regarding image manipulation specifically, Mike Rossner from the Journal of Cell Biology has said \(\[[Science ‘Bringing image manipulation to light’\]\(http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/10/bringing-image-manipulation-light](http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/10/bringing-image-manipulation-light)\)\)

* Around 25% of accepted papers at the JCB still violate the journal’s guidelines
* And in about 1% of papers, this would actually have changed the paper’s conclusion

_\*You can access these papers online via the university library electronic journals service._

## Impact of image manipulation in science

### The damage this causes:

* Wastes time – other scientists can’t replicate or build on results
* Wastes money – taxpayer money could be put to much better use
* Undermines trust in science

### Consequences include:

* Discipline via your institution
* Retraction of papers
* Removal of funding
* Legal consequences

## What's being done about the problem?

* Retraction Watch – [www.retractionwatch.com](http://www.retractionwatch.com/)
  * ...and the [Retraction Watch database](http://retractiondatabase.org/RetractionSearch.aspx?)
* PubPeer – [www.pubpeer.com](http://www.pubpeer.com/)
* [Australian Research Integrity Committee](http://www.arc.gov.au/research-integrity)
* Journals have instituted routine spot checks
  * Almost all the journals you might want to submit to are now members of [COPE \(Committee on Publication Ethics\)](https://publicationethics.org/)
  * Image forensics experts employed by some publishers
