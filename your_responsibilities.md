# Your responsibilities and how to protect yourself {#your-responsibilities}

Stick to these guidelines, and you'll do alright.

## Summary of journal policies and guidelines {#journal-policies-guidelines}

* Applies to all types of imaging; gels, blots and microscopy data
* Keep your unprocessed data!
* Must be an accurate representation of the data
* Images should have identical settings, and identical analysis
* Minimal alteration
* Apply changes to the entire image
* Don’t remove or add elements, or splice images
* Avoid non-linear adjustments
* Tell us exactly what you did to the image
* No pre-publication or duplication
* We screen for duplication, manipulation, and plagiarism

## Guidelines for appropriate imaging {#guidelines-for-appropriate-imaging}

These twelve guidelines for appropriate imaging were proposed in a paper published in 2010, and have stood the test of time. They are just as relevant today as they were then.

### Twisted Pivels: 12 Guidelines for appropriate imaging {#twisted-pixel-guidelines}

1. Scientific digital images are data that can be compromised by inappropriate manipulations.
2. Manipulation of digital images should only be performed on a copy of the unprocessed image data file \(always keep the original data file safe and unchanged!\)
3. Simple adjustments to the entire image are usually acceptable.
4. Cropping an image is usually acceptable.
5. Digital images that will be compared to one another should be acquired under identical conditions, **and** any post-acquisition image processing should also be identical.
6. Manipulations that are specific to one area of an image and are not performed on other areas are questionable.
7. Use of software filters to improve image quality is usually not recommended for biological images.
8. Cloning or copying objects into a digital image, from other parts of the same image or from a different image, is **very** questionable.
9. Intensity measurements should be performed on uniformly processed image data, and the data should be calibrated to a known standard.
10. Avoid the use of lossy compression. JPEG, etc.
11. Magnification and resolution are important.
12. Be careful when changing the size \(in pixels\) of a digital image.

## What to do if you a concern {#if-you-have-concerns}

How to raise concerns

* Use a collaborative, not adversarial approach
  * Assume goodwill, you’re all working towards a common goal
* You can refer to journal \(or other external\) guidelines
  * “We’ll probably want to publish this at some stage, so we should format things the way reviewers will want it now and not have to re-do it later.”
* You can contact a [Monash Research Integrity Advisor](http://www.intranet.monash/researchadmin/start/ethics/research-integrity/advisors)
* If you don’t feel comfortable with a situation, then take steps to remove yourself
  * You can decline co-authorship on papers
  * You can work on moving labs, or switching to another group with better support for your long term career goals
