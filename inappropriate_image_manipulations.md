# Inappropriate image manipulations {#inappropriate-image-manipulations}

Here is an overview of the major categories of inappropriate image manipulations.

* Image duplication
* Combining parts of images
* Removing parts of images
* Modifying different parts of an image in different ways

## INAPPROPRIATE: Image duplication {#image-duplication}

![](/assets/images/Bik_et_al.jpg)

A 2016 study by Bik _et al._ \(Bik _et al._ “The prevalence of inappropriate image duplication in biomedical research publications” _mBio,_ volume 7\(3\), 2016. **DOI:10.1128/mBio.00809-16**\):

* Examined 20,621 images published
* Across 40 different scientific journals
  > “A total of 20,621 research papers containing the search term “Western blot” from 40 different journals and 14 publishers were examined for inappropriate duplications of photographic images, with or without repositioning or evidence of alteration”

Only looked for one type of image manipulation:

* 3.8% of papers contained image duplication
* At least half were likely to be deliberate manipulation
  > “Among the 782 problematic papers found in this study, 230 \(29.4%\) contained simple duplications and 356 \(45.5%\) contained duplicated images with repositioning, while the remaining 196 \(25.1%\) contained duplicated figures with alteration.”

### Example: Image duplication of a Western blot

Int his example we see that the loading control has been duplicated - it can't really have come from both experiments A and B!

### Example: Woo Suk Hwang controversy

Woo Suk Hwang, biomedical researcher.

Woo Suk Hwang, _et al_. “Patient-specific embryonic stem cells derived from human SCNT blastocysts” _Science_, volume 308 pp.1777, 2005. **DOI: 10.1126/science.1112286**

In this figure, each column is meant to represent a different set of cells, under experimental conditions. But if we look a little close...![](/assets/images/WooSukHwang_ImageDuplication_1.jpg)![](/assets/images/WooSukHwang_ImageDuplication_2.jpg)![](/assets/images/WooSukHwang_ImageDuplication_3.jpg)... we see that these are not different cells at all!

## INAPPROPRIATE: Splicing images together {#splicing-images}

### Example: Splicing images to inappropriately add cells

Here multiple images have been spliced together to make it appear as though they were originally a single image. The image manipulation is revealed by a simple contrast adjustment.

### Example: Dipak K. Das controversy

Dipak K Das: **145** counts of data fabrication or falsification

This image is not from one of Dr Das' papers, but was prepared by the investigating committee as an explanation of the types of image manipulation techniques they found.

## INAPPROPRIATE: Removing parts of an image {removing-parts}

### Example: ACS Nano paper

The image may look ok at first glance:

But, looking closer, we see two regions that appear to have been inappropriately altered:

### Example: Removing cells inappropriately

Here we see an image of some cells. A simple contrast adjustment reveals some cells have been removed inappropriately from the bottom right:

## INAPPROPRIATE: Modifying different parts of an image in different ways {#modifying-partts}

### Example: Misrepresentation of immunogold data
